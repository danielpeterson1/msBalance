# Introduction
This document describes the analysis of standing balance responses in people with and without multiple sclerosis (MS) using wavelet-based functional ANOVA (wfANOVA[@mckay2013]).
MS has profound effects on balance,[@vanliew2019] including altering protective stepping behaviors.[@peterson2016]
The main objective of this study was to examine the impact of MS on the pattern of magnitude and timing of muscle activation during feet-in-place balance responses.

# concatenate the participants. note that some of them appear to be coded as follow-ups. this is very useful, but may not be needed for the first report. they appear to be coded as such by the presence of "F1", "F2" in the participant name. convert this to a visit number (1, 2, 3, 4)

## Data sources
This study analyzed existing electromyographic recordings during balance responses in people with and without MS.
An earlier analysis of a subset of these records is available.[@peterson2016]
Inclusion criteria for MS participants were as follows: diagnosis of MS by a MS neurologist and no relapses within 60 days.
Inclusion criteria for all participants included ability to walk 25 ft (7.6 m) without an assistive device, and no other known biomechanical or neurologic conditions affecting stepping or balance.

## Assessment protocol
Complete details of the assessment protocol are avaialble in an earlier report.[@huisinga2014] 
During each asssessment, subjects stood with arms folded across the chest, eyes open, with their feet at a fixed heel-to-heel distance of 10 cm on a set of 2 custom hydraulic force platforms that translated either forward or backward (`r figureNumbers("cartoon", display = "cite")`).
In this study, "perturbation direction" refers to the direction of postural sway caused by the surface translation.
Therefore, a backward perturbation refers to forward movement of the support surface causing backward body sway and the activation of tibialis anterior (TA),
whereas forward perturbations refer to backward translation of the support surface causing forward body sway and the activation of medial gastrocnemius (MG).
Six perturbations were delivered, three forward, followed by three backward.
Peak platform displacement was 4 cm, at a rate of 15 cm/s, which elicited feet-in-place balance corrections without stepping.

## Electromyography
Surface electromyography was recorded with pairs 2.5-cm^2^ surface electrodes placed approximately 2 cm apart, with a ground electrode on the lateral condyle. 
The activity of tibialis anterior (TA) and medial gastrocnemius (MG) were recorded.
For this analysis, we considered only the activity of tibialis anterior of the right leg.

## Data processing
Each individual EMG record was registered to the onset of treadmill motion and resampled to a common sample rate (1 kHz), and processed (high-pass, 35 Hz, de- mean, rectify, low-pass, 40 Hz) as in previous studies.[@lang2019; @mckay2016]
Recorded EMG records were visualized stratified by disease state and perturbation direction (`r figureNumbers("rawEmg", display = "cite")`).

# the treadmill records are not very useful, as they have not been cleaned up manually, so let's plan to assume Dan's coding of the study conditions.
# To your questions
#  
# 1)      We have bilateral TA and medial Gastroc. Specifically
# a.       Ch. 1= Rt. TA
# b.       Ch. 2= Lf. TA
# c.       Ch. 3= Rt. MG
# d.       Ch. 4= Lf. MG
# 2)      We have 6 trials per participant per visit (some people have multiple visits). Within each visit, they complete 6 trialsâ€¦
# a.       First 3 are FORWARD steps / loss of balance (i.e. the treadmill belt moves backward underfoot)

By visual inspection, there were some gross magnitude differences in recorded EMG levels between the MS and control groups, with higher EMG levels overall in the MS group.
EMG levels in most control participants (with the exception of MSC15 and MSC18) were generally roughly an order of magnitude lower than levels in MS participants.
This number is difficult to interpret, as it can reflect a large number of biological and methodological factors, so that increased absolute level among MS could reflect increased muscle activation or completely unrelated factors.
EMG levels were therefore normalized to the maximum values obtained in a 1 second window after perturbation onset after averaging across like trials (`r tableNumbers("emgMags", display = "cite")`).

```{r emgMags}
emgMags = 
  taRNorm %>% group_by(`Perturbation Direction`, Group) %>% summarize(Mean = mean(Vm) %>% round() ) %>% left_join(
    taRNorm %>% group_by(`Perturbation Direction`, Group) %>% summarize(SD = sd(Vm) %>% round() ) ) %>% left_join(
      taRNorm %>% group_by(`Perturbation Direction`, Group) %>% summarize(Max = max(Vm) %>% round() ) )
