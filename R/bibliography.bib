  abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate the impact of a single day of protective stepping practice in individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Background: Multiple Sclerosis is a leading cause of disability among young adults in the United States. Gait and balance dysfunction are both widespread in MS and strong predictors of falls, disability, and quality of life among those with MS.},

  abstract = {Objective: To characterize postural responses to forward and backward external perturbations in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS), and to relate performance to commonly used clinical outcomes. Design: Cross-sectional study. Postural responses were tested during large stepping and smaller feet-in-place perturbations in forward and backward directions. Setting: University research laboratory. Participants: PwMS (nZ54) and age-matched controls (nZ21) (NZ75). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Center of mass displacement and step latency after external perturbations.
Results: PwMS exhibited larger center of mass displacements and step latencies than control participants in response to stepping perturbations (PZ.003 and PZ.028, respectively). Stepping deficits were more pronounced during backward stepping and were significantly correlated to increased severity on clinical measures (European Database for Multiple Sclerosis disability score and Timed 25-Foot Walk).
Conclusions: Compensatory stepping is impaired in PwMS and correlates with clinical disability. Measurement of backward compensatory stepping may be more effective at identifying postural dysfunction in PwMS than forward compensatory steps. Prolonged step latencies, large anticipatory postural adjustments, and multiple compensatory steps are especially altered in PwMS, suggesting possible targets for neurorehabilitation.},

  title = {Statistically Significant Contrasts between {{EMG}} Waveforms Revealed Using Wavelet-Based Functional {{ANOVA}}},
  volume = {109},
  issn = {0022-3077, 1522-1598},
  abstract = {We developed wavelet-based functional ANOVA (wfANOVA) as a novel approach for comparing neurophysiological signals that are functions of time. Temporal resolution is often sacrificed by analyzing such data in large time bins, increasing statistical power by reducing the number of comparisons. We performed ANOVA in the wavelet domain because differences between curves tend to be represented by a few temporally localized wavelets, which we transformed back to the time domain for visualization. We compared wfANOVA and ANOVA performed in the time domain (tANOVA) on both experimental electromyographic (EMG) signals from responses to perturbation during standing balance across changes in peak perturbation acceleration (3 levels) and velocity (4 levels) and on simulated data with known contrasts. In experimental EMG data, wfANOVA revealed the continuous shape and magnitude of significant differences over time without a priori selection of time bins. However, tANOVA revealed only the largest differences at discontinuous time points, resulting in features with later onsets and shorter durations than those identified using wfANOVA ( P {$<$} 0.02). Furthermore, wfANOVA required significantly fewer ({$\sim$}\textonequarter\texttimes; P {$<$} 0.015) significant F tests than tANOVA, resulting in post hoc tests with increased power. In simulated EMG data, wfANOVA identified known contrast curves with a high level of precision ( r
              2
              = 0.94 {$\pm$} 0.08) and performed better than tANOVA across noise levels ( P {$<$} {$<$}0.01). Therefore, wfANOVA may be useful for revealing differences in the shape and magnitude of neurophysiological signals (e.g., EMG, firing rates) across multiple conditions with both high temporal resolution and high statistical power.},

  abstract = {Objective: To understand and examine the relation between postural response latencies obtained during postural perturbations and representative measures of balance during standing (sway variables) and walking (trunk motion). Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: University medical center. Participants: Persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) (nZ40) were compared with similar aged control subjects (nZ20). There were 20 subjects with MS in the normal walking velocity group and 20 subjects with MS who had slow walking velocity based on a timed 25-foot walk (T25FW) of {$<$}5 seconds. Interventions: None. Main Outcome Measures: Postural response latency, sway variables, trunk motion variables.
Results: We found that subjects with MS with both slow or normal walking velocities had significantly longer postural response latencies than the healthy control group. Postural response latency was not correlated with the T25FW. Postural response latency was significantly correlated with center of pressure sway variables during quiet standing (root mean square: rZ.334, PZ.04; range: rZ.385, PZ.017; mean velocity: rZ.337, PZ.038; total sway area: rZ.393, PZ.015). Postural response latency was also significantly correlated with motion of the trunk during walking (sagittal plane range of motion: rZ.316, PZ.05; SD of transverse plane range of motion: rZ{\`A}.43, PZ.006).
Conclusions: These findings clearly indicate that slow postural responses to external perturbations in patients with MS contribute to disturbances in balance control during both standing and walking.
